= Rails Support Extension =

Extending Radiant via the standard Rails action pack is a bit painful 
right now cause it's not easy to re-use the Radiant Layouts.

This Radiant Extension allows you to create Radiant Extensions that can 
use the normal Rail action pack to create rich database driven application 
but which are still tightly integrated via the Radiant layout system.

== Usage ==
Once this extension is installed, update your controllers so that 
they extended SiteController.  This extension adds a radiant_render
method to the SiteController which is identical to the standard
Rails render method except that it uses Radiant to layout the 
view.

For example, app/controllers/sample_controller.rb:
{{{
class SampleController < SiteController
  def index    
    radiant_render :layout=>"path/to/page"
  end    
end
}}}

The above will look up the Radiant page that maps to URL 
"path/to/page" and use that as the template for rendering the 
content of the rendered rhtml view.  Instead of using the page's body
part, the result of rendering the rhtml view will be used as the body.

If layout is not specified, it uses the layout of the root page.

This extension also adds a helper to include snippets from Radiant

For example, app/views/sample_controller/index.rhtml:
{{{
<h1>How to include a snippet:</h1>
<%= snippet("welcome")%>
}}}
