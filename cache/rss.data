	&lt;p&gt;A quick update today to announce the Hollywood Fringe newsletter courtesy of our friends at Mailchimp.  We conducted a major investigation into the best software to support this very important addition to our communications arsenal.  Mailchimp provides the most options as far as flexibility&amp;#8230;and as their website says, they actually manage to make email list management fun (perish the thought).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;d like to use this new tool to keep our Fringe community updated on the progress we are making on the festival.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://hollywoodfringe.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=9d5b214490502c44eb45683cb&amp;#38;id=ba6f6d5d4d&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to the newsletter directly from this website, so give it a go!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>A Brief History of Hollywood</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Most articles written on the history of Hollywood tell tale of the burgeoning movie industry of the golden age and the &amp;#8220;idea&amp;#8221; that is Hollywood: Entertainment capital of the world.  Hollywood is truly one of the major brands of the world, and its &amp;#8220;logo&amp;#8221; is probably recognizable by more citizens of the Earth than the facade of the White House. Once you begin to peel back the layers attached by world perception, we can perceive the real Hollywood as the neighborhood itself.  That&amp;#8217;s the subject of this article.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/Hollywood-1885.jpg&quot; height=&quot;120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://z.hubpages.com/u/50007_f520.jpg&quot; height=&quot;120px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/NestorStudios-Hollywood-1913.jpg&quot; height=&quot;120px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Most tales of this historic settlement begin with a lone Adobe house in 1853.  It was the beginning of a flourishing agricultural community producing grains, pineapples, and bananas (the latter two now sold in full deliciousness at the Sunset and Vine Smoothie King). All this changed when a gent named Harvey Wilcox bought 160 acres of land south of the foothills and amidst the Cahunega pass in a great real estate scheme designed to lure Midwesterners to &amp;#8220;winter&amp;#8221; on the coast. Having recently moved from the onslaught that is Midwestern winters, I sympathize.  It was Wilcox that paved Prospect Ave, which later became the famed Hollywood Blvd and the &amp;#8220;Walk of Fame&amp;#8221;.  Wilcox also built the Hollywood Hotel, the first of its kind in the area and on the same lot now used by the Kodak Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Other stories link the birth of Hollywood to a man named H. J. Whitley, the so-called Father of Hollywood.  A Midwestern real estate baron himself, he and his wife reportedly came up with the village&amp;#8217;s name on their honeymoon.  In any case, both Wilcox and Whitley managed to get streets named after them.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you may have heard, Hollywood was not originally called &amp;#8220;Hollywoodland&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; the original signage on the foothills overlooking Hollywood.  Indeed, this was the name of a real estate community built by Whitley associates Woodruff and Shoult, who marketed their development as a &amp;#8220;superb environment without excessive cost on the Hollywood side of the hills.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The entertainment industry roared into the neighborhood in 1910 with the entry of D. W. Griffith and his Biograph Company. Accompanying him was an acting company featuring a young Mary Pickford. The first full-fledged studio to set up shop was New Jersey-based Centaur Co at the corner of Sunset and Gower (yes, there is still studio space there).  1914 brought the first feature film made in a Hollywood studio: The Squaw Man, directed by Cecil B. DeMille.  By 1915, Paramount, Warner Bros, &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;RKO&lt;/span&gt;, and Columbia all had a major presence in the burgeoning film capital.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;And so the golden age of Hollywood began.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The 1940&amp;#8217;s and 50&amp;#8217;s saw the rise of television and Hollywood was the place to be.  The music recording business began its trek towards Hollywood as did radio.  With radio, film, television, and music colliding, the neighborhood solidified its reputation as the unchallenged entertainment capital of the world.  As decades progressed, the spirit of Hollywood busted past its borders.  Major studios moved out of the neighborhood that gave them birth and spread across Los Angeles.  The term &amp;#8220;Hollywood&amp;#8221; no longer referred to geographical place, per se, as much as an idea or even more abstract: A promise of the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Hollywood_boulevard_from_kodak_theatre.jpg/800px-Hollywood_boulevard_from_kodak_theatre.jpg&quot; height=&quot;120px&quot; /&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The 80&amp;#8217;s and 90&amp;#8217;s were rough for this gilded neighborhood, as it saw itself begin to decay.  The word &amp;#8220;seedy&amp;#8221; replaced &amp;#8220;glitzy&amp;#8221;, industry and tourism withered as crime took over.  This wasn&amp;#8217;t the end, though&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The 2000&amp;#8217;s represent nothing short of a rebirth for the fabled neighborhood.  Tourism picked up, and the Hollywood &amp;#38; Highland shopping complex was built on the grounds of Wilcox&amp;#8217;s old Hollywood Hotel. Industry began to return as did investment capital, shops, bars, restaurants, night clubs, music venues, and theatres.  It is now one of LA&amp;#8217;s premiere leisure spots as anyone looking for parking on a Saturday night will attest.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Earlier this decade, the Hollywood Media District was formed that amongst other things, established &amp;#8220;Theatre Row&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; a collection of 15 or so theatre spaces dotted up and down Santa Monica Blvd and Highland Ave.  And it is here that we set our scene.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;In 2010, we hope to add our own chapter to the storied history of this epic neighborhood.  Hope to see you there.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Meet the Fringe Freaks</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;All great endeavors require mascots: The Orioles Bird, Uncle Sam, The Keebler Elf (cookie-making counts as a &amp;#8220;great endeavor&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;We at the Hollywood Fringe didn&amp;#8217;t plan on a mascot&amp;#8230;it never occurred to us.  Until one morning I received an email from our graphic designer Gavin Worth.  He had been working on some branding ideas, one of which appeared to be a street corner with a whole bevy of freaky-type characters.  It also include a disparaging note about one of our mothers (identities hidden to protect the guilty).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;For some reason, it stuck and we have been plastering our new friends &amp;#8211; the &amp;#8220;Fringe Freaks&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; on much of our promotional materials.  Who knows, you may see these little guys walking up and down Santa Monica Blvd come Summer 2010.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;So without further introduction, I bring you The Freaks themselves:&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Twittering the Fringe</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Ain&amp;#8217;t technology fun.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;For those of you that are into the Twitter thing, good news for you!  The Hollywood Fringe now has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/hollywoodfringe&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&amp;#8217;t know what twitter is read on&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Twitter is a web utility you can use to post your current status and read the statuses of others.  For example, if I were eating lunch at a new restaurant in Hollywood, and I wanted everyone to know about it, I could tweet: &amp;#8220;eating lunch at this fabu restuarant&amp;#8230;y&amp;#8217;all should come sometime&amp;#8221;.  You get the idea, it&amp;#8217;s like a mini-blog post.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;(yes, I did use the verb &amp;#8220;to tweet&amp;#8221; which is the correct parlance for posting a status on Twitter)&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago (being a minor space geek) I decided to start following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/marsrover&quot;&gt;Mars Rover&lt;/a&gt; twitter.  I get updates every few hours on what that little guy is doing and seeing.  Recently, the Washington Post twittered the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;For you folks craving that moment-by-moment update on LA&amp;#8217;s first Fringe Festival, your appetites can be sated by checking our Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/hollywoodfringe&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=0 src=&quot;http://static.twitter.com/images/twitter_bubble_logo.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;We will try to keep it updated often for your viewing enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Fringe Website 2.0</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Barring some freak technological blip, you are reading this latest article on our new website, the hot bed of our future web-based adventures.  Welcome!&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The site is currently relatively bling-free, which is intentional.  Strolling through the gamut of international Fringe websites is a fun exercise.  Generally, they convey something of a chaos inherent in the perceived psyche of Fringe festivals.  This is a good idea as design conveys emotion and context, and this chaos fits well within the Fringe atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;We have slightly different aims in our web-world and that is to muster and communicate with the resources to bring this festival successfully home. The Internets is central to our awareness and promotion startegeries.  You may have already noticed that the &amp;#8220;blog&amp;#8221; element of our to-date web presence is front-and-center.  Communication is king, and best served on a clear and concise dinner plate.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;That said, we have plans to further develop our web presence from a design and content perspective.  So, I suppose a little bling is forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;We have added some more data on the festival itself and what is vies to achieve.  First on the menu of future features is a comment engine followed by a newsletter.  We will also be unveiling the &amp;#8220;alpha&amp;#8221; version of our submissions website, which will power the great democratic initiative of the Hollywood Fringe festival.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;So welcome!  The old fringe site is dead, long live the new fringe site.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A Fringe Documentary?</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I spoke with my cousin Bryce Wagoner last week about an idea we have been kicking around for a couple years now: A documentary on the creation of the Hollywood Fringe Festival.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Bryce is a good guy to have on-board: His documentary just received funding and it&amp;#8217;s starting production with Oxymoron Entertainment and the producers of Entourage, Punked, American Psycho, and the Emmy Nominated The Flight that Fought Back.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The idea for a documentary first emerged as we started production on our last endeavor: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hatcheryfestival.org&quot;&gt;The Hatchery Festival&lt;/a&gt; .  Theatre/Arts festivals are such bizarre creatures and attract such a freakish array of characters, how could it not translate to film?  Note that I use the term &amp;#8220;freakish&amp;#8221; with all love, respect, and self identification.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Bryce and I (along with Dave McKeever, the Producing Director for the Fringe) are just now beginning to bounce around some serious ideas that, so far, sound pretty entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The production of the Fringe itself would be the major through line&amp;#8230;along the way, we may:&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adventure through the history of past Fringes and why they matter&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Field trip to Scotland, Minneapolis, and/or Tortonto to see Fringe in action&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Interview various theatrical luminaries in the land of Fringe&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Follow artists as they create, develop, and produce their Fringe projects&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;..and of, course, lots of footage of Fringe week and all the madness therein&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Of course, we would  set the Hollywood community on center stage; presenting the modern Hollywood as a fascinating and unique place complimenting its role as the spiritual capital of the entertainment world.
As my cousin says, the best thing about shooting a documentary are the unknown gems you film&amp;#8230;the wild characters that stand out.  I imagine we will be pretty open to new experiences (that&amp;#8217;s the story of this Festival thus far).&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;In a few paragraphs, that&amp;#8217;s the general idea.  Looking forward to making some real progress on this particular project&amp;#8230;very excited to see where it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Emily Selden &amp; Firefly Sky Productions</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In our ongoing insiders&amp;#8217; peek at the good people joining the production of Los Angeles&amp;#8217; first Fringe Festival, I would like to introduce you to Emily Selden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a greetings direct from Emily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nfakPe&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/span&gt; Ann Selden dreams of the time when southern California will have a fringe festival to call it&amp;#8217;s own- that time is now. With a wealth of theater and business experience she is excited to partner her Westwood based company, Firefly Sky Productions, with Hatchery Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She began her theater career by winning &amp;#8220;drama member of the year&amp;#8221;, propelling her into college with a scholarship culminating in the completion of a Bachelors in Acting and a Masters in Production Management both in Theater Arts at Humboldt State University.  Fulfilling an internship with Dell&amp;#8217; Arte International School of Theater in Blue Lake, CA, she taught K-12 students in their &amp;#8220;Education through Art&amp;#8221; program- expanding the program and realizing a passion for &amp;#8220;Commedia&amp;#8221;. As a veteran of Renaissance Faire she is also a fan of &amp;#8220;Environmental Theatre&amp;#8221;.  More recently, at Victor Valley College in Victorville, CA she served as Theater Faculty while working as Talent Manager for two clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an accomplished producer she has managed the American College Theater Festival, Reggae on the River, and the Humboldt International Film Festival, among others. With her passion for the arts, theater, education and their ability to change the world she looks forward to a wonderfully creative collaboration with Hollywood Fringe.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Edinburgh Fringe Festival</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of Scotland&amp;#8217;s biggest show: The Edinburgh Fringe Festival.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;This is the Fringe that started them all&amp;#8230;   Back in 1947, eight rebel theatre companies gathered along the fringes of the establishment arts festival (The Edinburgh International Festival) and set up shop.  Over 60 years later, and the &amp;#8220;Fringe&amp;#8221; has eclipsed the establishment.  Not bad for a bunch of scrappy artists.&lt;/p&gt;


There is a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinyurl.com/56c72e&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the Economist magazine on the Fringe this year.  Of course our friends at the Economist are crusty, capitalist bastards&amp;#8230;so the commentary is quite amusing.   My favorite excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;UNLIKE&lt;/span&gt; every other theatre festival in the world, the Edinburgh Fringe completely takes over its host city. In an age when theatre has been pushed to the periphery of the culture, it’s jarring to see actors rehearsing Brecht in line for morning coffee, flocks of school-age drama students singing Stephen Sondheim in a back alley and most strikingly, marketing departments—usually comprised of actors in the shows being marketed—absolutely everywhere. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now that&amp;#8217;s exactly what we are talking about with Hollywood Fringe.  Taking the ordinary and sticking it on its head.  Our goal is to turn Hollywood into an unprecedented artistic freak show.  Not just to interrupt the blandness of ordinary life, but to excite, offend, and inspire those on the periphery of the art world to join its core.

	&lt;p&gt;There is some interesting commentary in there on the question of a &amp;#8220;juried&amp;#8221; festival &amp;#8230; one that we have been wrestling with.  How to put up a festival that allows for some form of artistic integrity check without betraying the spirit of  fringe.  We, of course, are moving in a third direction: Rather than allowing a small group of high-minded critics to choose the festival&amp;#8217;s content, we at Hollywood Fringe leave that decision to the &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/2007/11/21/the-fringe-the-internet-democracy/&quot;&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s exciting about Fringe is the wonderful discoveries that emerge from it.  And not just the artists are being discovered!  If history is any judge, Fringe audience members are easily converted to theatre-going patrons who continue to spend their cash on shows after the festival has closed its doors.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Discovering new artists, discovering new audience.  That&amp;#8217;s what fringe is about&amp;#8230;filling-in the artistic cracks that the mainstream leaves behind.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the Edinburgh Fringe Festival &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edfringe.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Jon Cohn &amp; The Mutineer Theatre Company</title>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We just held a meeting with Jon Cohn, Artistic Director of The Mutineer Theatre Company.  Jon is one of the fine individuals in the world of LA theatre partnering with us to produce Southern California&amp;#8217;s first Fringe Festival.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;The folks at Mutineer have some very interesting ideas, and I would suggest checking out their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mutineertheatre.com&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;For those of you free this coming Monday evening, they have a staged reading right here in Hollywood.  He tells me tickets are  going very fast, so if you are indeed interested, contact them today.  Here&amp;#8217;s the info:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr /&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;We (Mutineer Theatre Company) invite you to a &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;FREE&lt;/span&gt; Staged Reading of an original play by Keith Bridges on Monday, August 18th at 8pm.  This is the first full installment of the script commissioned by &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MTC&lt;/span&gt; and is the product of a collaborative process between Keith and the &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;MTC&lt;/span&gt; company.&lt;/p&gt;


	&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WHAT&lt;/span&gt;:  Staged Reading with a post-read discussion moderated by James Utt.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WHEN&lt;/span&gt;:  Monday, August 18th at 8pm&lt;/li&gt;

Once you enter the lobby the theatre is on the left.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/span&gt;:  Jon Cohn, Jennifer Douglas-Craig, Amy Farrington, Luke Goldstein, Marty Lodge, and Amy Schloerb&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;


	&lt;p&gt;As part of our mission to create and develop original material, your participation in this collaborative process is hugely beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
